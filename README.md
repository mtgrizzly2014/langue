## The Langue Project [WIP]

Langue provides an infrastructure for creating and learning languages. The main aim is to be the most common platform for online and offline conlanging. It works on any of JavaScript engines so the utilities and interfaces are isomorphic and universal across different platforms.

Not only does Langue support phonetic distinctive channel, but also kinesic or more unusual, even conworldlike ways (something impossible for earthlings) to distinguish meanings of discourse, serialising it into specific data format.

Currently in the planning stage.

The official web service will be coming to [langue.link](https://langue.link/) and its [repository](https://github.com/yuhr/langue.link).

## Plan

Langue consists of these parts:

- Schema
  - a unified schema for language description
- Engines and Utilities
  - Dictionary
    - search on these fields:
      - lemma (proximity scoring with phonetic distance)
      - translation (search with synonyms)
      - description (full-text search)
    - filter by:
      - tags (e.g. parts of speech)
      - timestamp (created, last modified)
  - Lexicon
    - not dictionary
    - corpus-based construction
  - Grammar and Spell Checking
  - Corpus and Discourse Database
  - Discourse Awkwardness Scoring
  - Statistics
    - calculate the frequency of syntactic form, words, syllables and phonemes
  - Translation
    - Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT)
    - Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
  - Utterance I/O Processing
    - recognition
    - synthesis
    - atmospheric composition aware acoustic transforming
  - ? Ontology Database
  - Conscripting Assinstance
- API
  - a unified interface for querying informations about languages

These features would be selectable for specific use.

### Libraries and Frameworks

- Language: TypeScript
- Database: PouchDB (RxDB?)
- Query: GraphQL
- Schema: JSON-Schema (autogenerated from TypeScript interface definition)
- Document: doca, JSDoc

## General Terms

An "*utterance*" means a set of physical actions which comprises a discourse. An utterance consists of a series of distinctive channels. In some cases there might be more than one utterer in an utterance. A generalised term of "speech" or "pronunciation".

A "*discourse*" means a set of utterances, things uttered and contexts of utterers. The number of utterances a discourse has depends on how they are clipped out from the discourse. Also includes written text.

A "*context*" means a compound of utterer's own upbringing and all experiences until the utterance. In most cases each utterer has a more or less different context even in the same discourse, and his/her utterances are made always on the basis of that.

A "*distinctive channel*" means a uniform manner to utter, such as phonetic sound, intonation, percussive sound and kinesic gesture. Every language has one or more distinctive channels, and each form of lexical items has one or more elementary layers correspond to each channel. Each channel may or may not be necessary to utter, and sometimes selectable according to the case of utterance or discourse.
